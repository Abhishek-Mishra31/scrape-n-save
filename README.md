# LinkedIn Profile Scraper

A Node.js/TypeScript application that scrapes LinkedIn profiles using Puppeteer with stealth capabilities.

## Features

- Scrapes LinkedIn profile data including work experience, education, projects, and skills
- Handles LinkedIn authentication via cookies
- Uses Puppeteer with stealth plugin to avoid detection
- Saves scraped data to JSON files
- RESTful API endpoints

## API Endpoints

- `POST /scrape` - Scrape a LinkedIn profile by URL
  ```json
  {
    "profileUrl": "https://linkedin.com/in/username"
  }
  ```

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create `.env` file with your LinkedIn credentials:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   LINKEDIN_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
   LINKEDIN_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

3. Run in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## Deployment on Render

### Method 1: Using Render Dashboard

1. **Prepare your repository:**
   - Push your code to GitHub
   - Ensure all files including `render.yaml` are committed

2. **Create a new Web Service on Render:**
   - Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
   - Click "New" â†’ "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub repository

3. **Configure the service:**
   - **Name:** linkedin-scraper (or your preferred name)
   - **Environment:** Node
   - **Build Command:** `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Start Command:** `npm start`
   - **Plan:** Starter (or higher for better performance)

4. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - `NODE_ENV` = `production`
   - `LINKEDIN_EMAIL` = your LinkedIn email
   - `LINKEDIN_PASSWORD` = your LinkedIn password
   - `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD` = `true`
   - `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` = `/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable`

5. **Deploy:**
   - Click "Create Web Service"
   - Wait for the build and deployment to complete

### Method 2: Using render.yaml (Infrastructure as Code)

1. The included `render.yaml` file will automatically configure your service
2. Just add your LinkedIn credentials as environment variables in the Render dashboard
3. Render will use the configuration from `render.yaml`

## Important Notes for Render Deployment

### Puppeteer Configuration
- Render doesn't include Chrome by default, so we use the system Chrome
- The `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` points to the system Chrome installation
- Additional Chrome flags are included for stability in containerized environments

### File System Considerations
- Scraped data and cookies are saved to the container's file system
- Files will be lost on container restarts (ephemeral storage)
- For persistent storage, consider using external storage services

### Performance Considerations
- LinkedIn scraping can be resource-intensive
- Consider using a higher-tier plan for better performance
- Be mindful of LinkedIn's rate limits and terms of service

### Security
- Never commit your `.env` file with real credentials
- Use Render's environment variables for sensitive data
- Be aware that LinkedIn scraping may violate their terms of service

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues on Render:

1. **Puppeteer fails to launch:**
   - Ensure `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` is set correctly
   - Check that all Chrome flags are included

2. **Memory issues:**
   - Consider upgrading to a higher-tier plan
   - Optimize Puppeteer configuration

3. **LinkedIn blocking requests:**
   - Check cookie validity
   - Implement delays between requests
   - Use different user agents

### Monitoring
- Check Render logs for debugging information
- Monitor memory and CPU usage
- Set up alerts for service availability
